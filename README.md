# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets
This repository documents my attempts at a kaggle NLP competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started



# Results:
1. Recent attempt: documented under "notebooks" folder

    - Solved using SOTA TRANSFORMERS models
    - improved performance significantly with much less manual preprocessing
    

2. Past attempt: documented under "past folder"

    - being rather inexperienced, this attempt uses manual visualisation, thereafter extraction of textual features into categorical and numerical features
    - Catboost and random forest models were used
